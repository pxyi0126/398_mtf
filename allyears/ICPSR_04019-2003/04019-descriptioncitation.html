		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<div><strong>Alternate Title:</strong> <p>MTF 2003 (12th Grade)</p></div>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> This is the 29th annual survey in this series that explores
changes in important values, behaviors, and lifestyle orientations of
contemporary American youth. Students are randomly assigned to
complete one of six questionnaires, each with a different subset of
topical questions, but all containing a set of "core" questions on
demographics and drug use. There are about 1,400 variables across the
questionnaires. Drugs covered by this survey include tobacco, alcohol,
marijuana, hashish, LSD, hallucinogens, amphetamines (stimulants),
Ritalin (methylphenidate), Quaaludes (methaqualone), barbiturates
(tranquilizers), cocaine, crack cocaine, GHB (gamma hydroxy butyrate),
and heroin. Other items include attitudes toward religion, changing
roles for women, educational aspirations, self-esteem, exposure to
drug education, and violence and crime (both in and out of school).</span></p>

								<div><strong>Date of Collection:</strong> <p>2003 (Spring)</p></div>
								<div><strong>Data Collection Notes:</strong> <p>To protect the privacy of respondents, all
variables that could be used to identify individuals have been
collapsed or recoded in the public use files. These modifications
should not affect analytic uses of the public use files., Variables
omitted from the Western region questionnaires are noted in each
codebook., A user guide is provided with the study documentation.
It contains a year-to-year cross-time question index for the MTF
12th-grade surveys that is sorted by subject area, item reference
number, and questionnaire form., MTF does not release detailed geography codes in its public use files because of the disclosure risk it would cause. The MTF sample is drawn to generate representative samples of the four Census Bureau regions of the country (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West), but it does not generate representative samples of smaller geographic areas such as states, counties, or cities. For additional information about data that is withheld from the public use files please contact MTF directly at <a href="mailto:mtfinformation@umich.edu">mtfinformation@umich.edu</a>.</p></div>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> Multistage area probability sample design involving three
 selection stages: (1) geographic areas or primary sampling units
 (PSUs), (2) schools (or linked groups of schools) within PSUs, and (3)
 students within sampled schools. Of the 72 PSUs, 8 were selected with
 certainty, 10 were selected with a probability of .50, and the
 remainder were selected with probability proportionate to the size of
 the senior class. In schools with more than 350 seniors, a random
 sample of seniors or classes was drawn. In schools with less than 350
 seniors, all seniors were asked to participate. Each school was asked
 to participate for two years so that each year one-half of the sample
 is replaced. Schools refusing participation were replaced with similar
 schools in terms of geographic location, size, and type of school
 (e.g., public, private/Catholic, private/non-Catholic). The total
 sample was divided into six subsamples consisting of an average of
 2,300 respondents, and each subsample was administered a different
 form of the questionnaire, although all respondents answered the
 "core" drug and demographic questions. The participation rate among
 schools has been between 66 and 85 percent since the inception of the
study.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> High school seniors in the contiguous United States.</span></p>
								<div><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> <p>survey data</p></div>
								<div><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> <p>self-enumerated questionnaire</p></div>
								<p><span><strong>Response Rates:</strong> The overall student response rate for 2003 was 83
percent.</span></p>

and documentation.<p>2006-03-30 File UG4019.ALL.PDF was removed from any
 previous datasets and flagged as a study-level file, so that it will
accompany all downloads.<p>2005-11-04 On 2005-03-14 new files were added to
 one or more datasets. These files included additional setup files as
 well as one or more of the following: SAS program, SAS transport, SPSS
 portable, and Stata system files. The metadata record was revised
2005-11-04 to reflect these additions.<p><p>2004-10-29 ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Standardized missing values.</li><li>Created online analysis version with question text.</li><li>Performed recodes and/or calculated derived variables.</li><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></p></div>
