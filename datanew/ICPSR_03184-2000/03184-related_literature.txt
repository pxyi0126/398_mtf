This paper is intended to serve as a supplement to a larger annual volume,
"Monitoring the Future National Survey Results on Drug Use, 1975-2001:
Volume 1, Secondary School Students." Demographic and prevalence trends are
provided for all of the drugs being studied. This paper contains graphic
presentations of those trends. The demographic subgroups are defined by
gender, college plans, region of the country, population density, education
level of the parents (a proxy for socioeconomic level), and racial/ethnic
identification. Trend data are presented for 12th grade students beginning
in 1975 and for 8th and 10th grades beginning in 1991.

the differentiation of the various trend lines in each graph.) The graphic
presentations have not been included in
